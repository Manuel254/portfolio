            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a second year student at South Eastern Kenyan University, Kitui, Kenya currently  
                pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am passionate in programming and would like 
                to achieve a lot from it. There are many programming languages that I would love to 
                learn but I have dedicated most of my time in learning python so as to dive into the 
                machine learning path and I also do web development as a freelance. My programming 
                journey has been so far so good though I have faced many challenges but those are what 
                keep me going. I am positive someday that I would become a seasoned developer. My 
                hobbies are programming, playing basketball, reading and playing musical instruments 
                such as the guitar and piano. I also  love to teach other people programming as it keeps 
                me on toes.</p>
